background
Drug combinations, compared to monotherapies, have the potential to increase efficacy, reduce host toxicity and overcome drug resistance. However, screening novel synergistic drug pairs is challenging due to the enormous number of potential combination space. Further, lacking the understanding of mechanism of action (MoA) also limits the application of drug combinations. Our model utilizes different granularity level transformers to capture biological interactions from different dimensions.

dataset
drug combinations can be stored in directory data.

training data
cd data && "wget https://baidu-nlp.bj.bcebos.com/PaddleHelix/datasets/drug_synergy_datasets/DTSyn.tgz" && tar xzvf DTSyn.tgz
usage
We use main.py for illustration, the cmdline is as follows:

CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 main.py 
                         --ddi ./data/ddi.csv
                         --lincs ./data//gene_vector.csv
                         --rna ./data/rna.csv
                         --epochs 150
