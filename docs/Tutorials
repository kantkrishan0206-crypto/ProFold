Background

Machine learning (ML), especially deep learning (DL), is becoming increasingly important in bioinformatics and computational biology. For example:

DL-based methods can predict drugâ€“target interactions and molecular properties efficiently, which previously required expensive in vitro/in vivo experiments or computationally intensive simulations.

In silico protein folding, RNA folding, and other structural predictions are now more feasible using deep neural models.

ML and DL improve efficiency, reduce cost, and accelerate drug discovery, vaccine design, and molecular research.

A key challenge in adopting DL is the limited availability of annotated data. Pre-training with self-supervised learning on large unlabeled datasets has proven highly effective in natural language processing and computer vision. Similarly, in molecular representation learning, we have:

Protein sequences: over 100 million

Compounds: over 50 million

Annotated datasets: relatively small

Profold leverages pre-training techniques to learn universal representations of chemical compounds, proteins, RNA, and more, bridging the gap between large unlabeled datasets and limited annotated data.
